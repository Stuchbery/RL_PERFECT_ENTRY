### Reinforcement-Learning-Market-Entry ###

Machine Learning Reinforcement Learning Algorithm - Algo tries to learn how to enter the BTC/USD market.

Extend on from 8 part tutorial RL series. Link: https://goo.gl/6Z5Mp7 

This code is from when I was experimenting with ML for algorithmic trading. I think a Reinfocrement Learning algo with PPO and a very well written reward function to maximize the desired strategy is something I'd look into in the future. 

NOTE 
Currently I've found HFT algos to be more profitable than ML algos.
